## Xamarin Forms FlowListView App

Little Xamarin Forms app with FlowListView control. 
There is the timer property in the DataTemplate of the FlowListView control in the app. 
The value of the property changed right in the Android app but not in the Windows UWP app.

I changed label to entry and I got also Windows UWP app working!
